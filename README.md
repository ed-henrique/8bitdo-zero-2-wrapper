# 8BitDo Zero 2 Wrapper

This wrapper takes the input from the joystick to turn it into an effective remote controller for my Hyprland setup. It is totally based off my setup, so it probably won't work in your computer.

## Roadmap

**Only working in Linux for the foreseeable future**

- [x] Detect input
- [ ] Map inputs to OS commands
- [ ] Handle joystick disconnection
